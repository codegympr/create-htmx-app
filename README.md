## Introduction

Create HTMX App is a CLI tool designed to kickstart front-end web projects using htmx. It streamlines the setup process, providing a pre-configured environment with htmx for dynamic, AJAX-driven content. This tool is perfect for developers looking to leverage htmx's simplicity and power without the overhead of manual configuration.

## Installation

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.

To install Create HTMX App, run:

npm install -g new-htmx-app

## Usage

To create a new project, simply run:

new-htmx-app your-project-name

Navigate into your project folder to start working on your app.
